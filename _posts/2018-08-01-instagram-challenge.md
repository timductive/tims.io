It&#8217;s never too soon to start creating content and a following for your new business. Ideally, you would have a good amount of social validation before you even get to your official launch day. This challenge is a good way to get in the groove of adding content to Instagram and figuring out your audience and branding.

## Create Your Content

  * You&#8217;ll be posting images to your Instagram account once a day during a 30 day time period, following a set pattern
  * For this you&#8217;ll need 8 manicured product photos, 8 random cool photos, 7 candid product photos (or action shots or photos that your customers have previously shared), and 7 memes (or quotes) 
      * If you are still early into prelaunch and don&#8217;t have product photos, find some stock photos that fit your motif or convey the idea of what will come in your box
  * Spend some time getting all your images together, creating captions for each one and determining the best hashtags to use
  * Helpful Free Tools:

There are many tools to help automate things for Instagram but many of these tools violate Instagram&#8217;s terms of service. Use these tools with caution as they may cause Instagram to block or even shut down your account.

## Post Everyday

Post to Instagram once a day (for 30 consecutive days), following a set pattern that alternates between manicured product photo, random cool photo, candid product photo, and meme.
