In a co-located company it is easy to take for granted how many opportunities there are to get to know your colleagues as humans, there's the water cooler, coffee maker, lunch cafeteria, weekly happy hours, company picnics, movies, holiday parties, the list is endless in all the tiny ways we learn and bond with each other.

When you work for a remote, fully distributed company, this becomes something to actively solve. One way to partially solve this problem is to do what many distributed companies do. Invest heavily in one or two big events a year where everyone travels to the same city, alternates between drinking caffeine and booze and spends every waking hour together for a week. I'm not knocking this by the way, this is great, it's fun and everyone holds on to those crazy fun moments for six months or a year until the next one.

But now what do we do? Covid-19 has pushed everyone to be a remote company and, simultaneously, prevented everyone from this one proven solution to connect with each other.

Even without travel disappearing overnight, teams function better when us humans know and care about each other personally (spoken from a true introvert). The answer is to treat these social events as part of work. 

In a co-located company you do these things because it's almost impossible not to. You go to get a drink, there's a person, you have to eat lunch, so does everyone, you need to decompress a bit, there's a bar with a great happy hour a block away. In this environment, it's easy to view these things as almost, in the way of the actual work, and they can be if that is all you do.

In a distributed company everything veers sharply the other direction. You can code, or write emails or documents, plan things in spreadsheets and an entire day goes by the next time you come up for air. It's absolutely wonderful for doing individual work (once you teach yourself how to be disciplined in your home). 

But, in this environment, the system can also be less than the sum of its parts. If everyone is moving in their own individual direction, you lose that extra magic that is capable of moving mountains. Instead, everyone is just running around pushing their own mole hills and ignoring the bigger picture.

Now, you can invent processes and meetings and check-ins. You can do scrum and hire black-belt project managers who know how to burndown chart and write JIRA tickets and email. This would work in an emotionless void and the trains would run on time.

Or, you can play video games.

The real solution here is a vast array of tiny things. You can do random Slack coffee chats (for extroverts), morning team coffee, afternoon team tea (for the Brits), the trick is to do two things. One, do things that expose people to others outside of their immediate area. Two, do things as a team, with the people you work with every day.
