# How to Stream Video Games to Zoom

One of the big challenges with working at a remote/distributed company is that it is difficult to replace the watercooler, off-the-cuff team bonding experience. Video calls tend to focus on business and meeting efficiency and it is awkward to try and shoot the breeze for a few minutes and learn something personal about each other. 

One solution that my team has discovered is video games, and in this case specifically, [Overcooked 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/728880/Overcooked_2/) on the Nintendo Switch. For deeper thoughts on how to socialize from home, see my companion article, this article will focus on the nuts and bolts of getting your computer setup.

## What you will need:

1. [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/switch/) (Not the Switch Lite)
2. [Nintendo Dock](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VHZC2T6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (I prefer this after-market one)
3. [HDMI Capture Card](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07C6KCBYB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
4. [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)
5. [Zoom](https://zoom.us/)
