# How to Stream Video Games to Zoom

One of the big challenges with working at a remote/distributed company is that it is difficult to replace the watercooler, off-the-cuff team bonding experience. Video calls tend to focus on business and meeting efficiency and it is awkward to try and shoot the breeze for a few minutes and learn something personal about each other. 

One solution that my team has discovered is video games, and in this case specifically, [Overcooked 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/728880/Overcooked_2/) on the Nintendo Switch. For deeper thoughts on how to socialize from home, see my companion article, this article will focus on the nuts and bolts of getting your computer setup.

## What you will need:

1. [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/switch/) (Not the Switch Lite)
2. [Nintendo Dock](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VHZC2T6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (I prefer this after-market one)
3. [Mirabox HDMI Capture Card](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07C6KCBYB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
4. [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)
5. [Zoom](https://zoom.us/)

## Setup Capture Card

The [Mirabox Capture Card](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07C6KCBYB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) is a bit of an investment at $99.99 but it is still on the low-end for these devices and roughly half the cost of the more premium [Elgato Capture Cards](https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Game-Capture-HD60-PlayStation/dp/B07VWXCXM7?th=1). I'm not looking to be a professional Twitch streamer so the Mirabox suits my needs just fine.

The hardware setup is pretty straightforward. Your Nintendo Dock HDMI plugs directly into the Mirabox, which then plugs into your computer via USB 3.0. I would also recommend using the HDMI loopout to forward the signal to a spare computer monitor. Trying to play directly from the Zoom stream will prove to be too laggy to be useful.
