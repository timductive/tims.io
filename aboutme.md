I focus on creating accountability, tracking metrics, and cultivating a culture of mentorship and collaboration. I build engineering teams that think about the product holistically and learn to balance cross-functional planning, velocity and quality.

Currently, I live in the suburbs of Austin, Texas with my wife, Tina, and 3 kids, Owen, Harper, and Charlie. I am half-Mexican and half-German and was born and raised in Texas so I naturally love tacos and beer. In my spare time I enjoy indoctrinating my children into my nerdy hobbies like video/board games, superhero movies and books.
